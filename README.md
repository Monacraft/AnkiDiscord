# Discord Rich Presence for Anki (AnkiDiscord)

### Description
This add-on will link Anki to Discord using Rich Presence.
It will show what you are currently doing on Anki (Main menu, browsing, adding or reviewing).
It will also show how many cards you have due, how many you have done today and how long you've been on Anki for.


A great way to share your progress with friends or motivate each other online
