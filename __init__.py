##### Adding Hooks
# afterStateChange --> base states
# browser.setupMenus --> loading browser
# setupEditorShortcuts --> editor (in browser and add)
# showAnswer --> new answer
# AddCards.onHistory --> opening browser via Add Cards
# (Note: Decided to remove last one since obsolete)
#
#addHook("afterStateChange", onState)
gui_hooks.state_did_change.append(onState) # New Hook for new Version

addHook("setupEditorShortcuts", onEditor)
addHook("showAnswer", onAnswer)
